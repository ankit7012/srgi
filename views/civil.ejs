            <h2>Seminars & Workshops</h2>
            <p>
              Seminars and workshops provide a chance to interact with experts from the specific field. Discussing about the relevant topics of the particular subject, students tend to learn about the latest information and new skills related to the concerned subject. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In a learning environment different and unique from classrooms, students learn more effectively and efficiently. Far from the textbooks and academic syllabuses, students research and learn on their own which boost their confidence, performance, and productivity.
            </p>
