            <h2>Seminars & Workshops</h2>
            <p>
              Seminars and workshops provide a chance to interact with experts from the specific field. Discussing about the relevant topics of the particular subject, students tend to learn about the latest information and new skills related to the concerned subject. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In a learning environment different and unique from classrooms, students learn more effectively and efficiently. Far from the textbooks and academic syllabuses, students research and learn on their own which boost their confidence, performance, and productivity.

               Close monitoring of the progress of the B.Tech. students are ensured by a team of <em>Research Associates and Teaching Assistants employed in the department</em>. All the labs are staffed with technical staff having vast experience in the Industry or with labs in top academic Institutions, who assist students in performing experiments.</p><p> Professional excellence, Self-Discipline, Professional attitude, and all around the development of students is encouraged by the Department throughout their stay.

               There is an Automobile lab equipped with state-of-the-art facilities to provide hands-on experience on an Automobile engine. The student has to work on various activities like <em>dismantling, overhauling and assembling of an engine which is the example of the way in which education is imparted to the students</em>.</p><p>
               
               Team Tornadoes Racing is official Baja Racing team of SRGI Mechanical Engineering Students, which participates in various Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Events. It has an SAE Collegiate Club comprising of 50+ students from all four years, who volunteered their time and talents to conceive the design and build small scale All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV ) for SAE events under the able guidance of Faculty Members. The Team Tornadoes racing is an entirely student-run competition team and every year they design and manufacture a new race vehicle. The objective of Team Tornadoes racing is to take our University's young aspiring Mechanical Engineers to push to their limits so that they can strengthen their minds to improvise the theoretical knowledge in today life.
