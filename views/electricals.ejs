               Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design and application of equipment, devices and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution and use.

               The department has well-established laboratories like Basic Electrical Engineering Lab, Networks Lab, Machines Lab(DC Machine Lab & AC Machine Lab), Power Electronics Lab, Power Systems Lab, Control & Instrumentation Lab and Simulation Lab.
               The department provides the students with academic, extracurricular and other resources to help them assimilate the engineering principles and apply the same in context with real applications. The students are encouraged to design and build a project of their choice in the final semester that helps them to apply the nuances of their theoretical principles with the practical aspects.

            <h2>Seminars & Workshops</h2>
            <p>
              Seminars and workshops provide a chance to interact with experts from the specific field. Discussing about the relevant topics of the particular subject, students tend to learn about the latest information and new skills related to the concerned subject. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In a learning environment different and unique from classrooms, students learn more effectively and efficiently. Far from the textbooks and academic syllabuses, students research and learn on their own which boost their confidence, performance, and productivity.
            </p>

               Mr. Ajit Singh, General Manager, Business Development Unit of Hindustan Power Projects Pvt. Ltd. delivered a lecture entitled, Hydro Power: White Gold on the 11th of March at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharda University on special invitation of Prof. Jatley. Mr Singh spoke at length on some of the finer nuances of evolution of Hydro power plants in Indian against the backdrop of the critical role of Hindustan Power Projects. Several faculty members who teach the subject at Sharda found the interaction extremely informative and enlightening. The students were equally excited to learn about the detailed operational aspects of technology and management issues associated with Hydro plants. The lecture followed a lively question and answer session in which the audience showed their extreme inquisitiveness."
